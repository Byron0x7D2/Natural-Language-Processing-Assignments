# Natural-Language-Processing-Assignments
Repositry with my assignements for the Natural Language Processing class (YS19 uoa) 

In an attempt to do sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset, I use  logistic regression (HW1), Feed Forward NN (HW2), Recurrent NN (HW3) and a pre trained BERT (HW4) model. 

In addition, using again pre trained a pre trained BERT model, I developed a simple question answering over knowledge graphs engine that you can find in the HW4 folder.
